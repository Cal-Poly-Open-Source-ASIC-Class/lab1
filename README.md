Welcome to your first lab in Open Source ASIC Design!

# Getting Started
At this point, you should have followed the [Docker Installation](https://github.com/Cal-Poly-Open-Source-ASIC-Class) instructions and have already cloned the [Asic Tools](https://github.com/Cal-Poly-Open-Source-ASIC-Class/asic-tools) repository. 

- Start by __forking__ this repository, __not__ cloning it. This will create a copy that you own.
- Then, clone your forked copy into the `workspace`  folder. In other words, `cd` into `asic-tools/workspace`, and then `git clone <your forked copy>`
